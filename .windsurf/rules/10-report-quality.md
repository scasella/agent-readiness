# Report quality bar

The report must be usable by a technical lead without additional explanation.

## Visual & structural expectations

- Clear title and metadata (repo name, run id, timestamp, commit).
- Executive summary at the top:
  - Level achieved (1–5)
  - Overall pass rate
  - Top 3 strengths (pillars) and top 3 opportunities (criteria)
  - 2–5 prioritized action items
- Breakdowns:
  - Five maturity levels with pass rates
  - Eight pillars with pass rates
  - Full criterion listing grouped by pillar

## Recommendation style

For each recommended fix:
- Describe the problem in plain language
- Explain why it matters for autonomous work
- Provide concrete remediation steps
- Link to relevant files in the repo (paths)
