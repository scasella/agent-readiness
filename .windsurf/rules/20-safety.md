# Safety & repo hygiene

- Do not modify source code unless explicitly asked. This pack is an **assessment** by default.
- Writing artifacts is allowed under `artifacts/rt-agent-readiness/`.
- Do not add new dependencies to the repo. The evaluator uses Python standard library only.
- If commands may be destructive, do not run them.
