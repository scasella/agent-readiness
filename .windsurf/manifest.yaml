description: >
  A Windsurf-native assessment pack that evaluates how ready a repository is for
  agent-driven development.

  It produces a visually polished HTML report, a Markdown report, and a
  machine-readable JSON scorecard with prioritized recommendations.

  The pack also includes an optional, safe-by-default remediation workflow that
  can scaffold high-leverage repo hygiene assets (docs/templates/config) to help
  teams progress toward the next maturity level.

entrypoints:
  - command: "/rt-agent-readiness"
    workflow: ".windsurf/workflows/rt-agent-readiness.md"

  - command: "/rt-agent-readiness-remediate"
    workflow: ".windsurf/workflows/rt-agent-readiness-remediate.md"

outputs:
  - artifacts/rt-agent-readiness/**/outputs/readiness.json
  - artifacts/rt-agent-readiness/**/outputs/report.html
  - artifacts/rt-agent-readiness/**/outputs/report.md
  - artifacts/rt-agent-readiness/**/outputs/remediation_plan.md
  - artifacts/rt-agent-readiness/**/outputs/remediation_plan.json

policies:
  network: "offline-by-default"
  external_tool_servers: "not-used"

notes:
  - "Designed for enterprise repos. Evaluation is deterministic and local where possible."
  - "Some governance signals may require repo-host metadata; those are marked as skipped."
  - "Remediation is opt-in. By default it generates a plan; applying changes requires an explicit flag."
