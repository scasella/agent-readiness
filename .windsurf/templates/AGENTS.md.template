4. Update docs and tests as needed
5. Summarize risk and verification evidence

## Risk & safety notes

- Never write secrets into code, docs, or logs
- Prefer additive changes that are easy to revert
- For migrations / data changes, include a rollback plan
- If unsure about a change’s safety, stop and ask for review
